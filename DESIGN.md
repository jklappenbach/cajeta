#Class Design
- LLVM Structure for Classes
  - className: String
  - Virtual Table
    - Entry per method
    - Function pointers to highest superclass entry if no override
  - Reflection Table
    - methodName: String
      - overrides: Array<Array<Type*>>
        - parameters: Array<Type*>
          - parameter: Type*
      - Entries ordered by methodName for quick binary search during compilation
- Annotations
  - Like Java, have a version of annotations that act as markers
    - Example: Spring @Components, which are automatically instantiated by the Spring Framework
  - Also feature injection annotation classes with the ability to inject llvm IR with the following strategy:
    - When injection annotation is detected, 
      - The implementation annotation class will be JIT compiled 
      - Directly executed as part of the compilation process
      - Compiler will call the injection code, providing the callback with the current event and injection API object
        - Events defined below
        - API object has access to the current module definition, and can call IR generation methods just like the listener
    - AOP Annotations specifically for
      - Class
        - Base interface features a callback method offering an AOP object
          - Callback Events
            - Class fields declared
            - Class methods declared
            - Class definition complete
          - AOP Capabilities
            - Add field
            - Set field value
            - Add method
            - Wrap method
      - Class field
        - Callback Events
          - Class field declared
        - AOP Capability
          - Set field value
          - Add method
          - Wrap method
      - Class method
        - Callback Events
          - Class method declared
        - AOP Capability
          - Wrap method
      - Class method parameter
        - Callback Events
          - Parameter declared
        - AOP Capability
          - Set parameter value
- Runtime Module
  - [cajeta.lang.Class<T>](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Class.html)
  - [cajeta.lang.Object](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html)
    - hashCode: default method based on murmur3
    - equals
    - toString
    - finalize
    - getClass
    - wait
    - notify
    - notifyAll
    - wait(long timeout)
    - wait(long timeout, int nanos)
  - StringLibrary
    - Entry for each string allocated
      - All strings allocated at compile time are located inline
      - Pointers to strings allocated at runtime are to the heap
    - String Class Interaction
      - Strings receive argument strings on the stack
      - GetOrAdd string by hash in the library.
